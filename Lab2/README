Bryan-

Most of the Output files were too big to push to GitHub, even when zipped.
This lab is definitely not my best work. I was satisfied enough that I got all of the functions to work. 
The path was not truly optimized nor did I have time to complete the 'export to animation' element. 
I tried to account for that in my self-review.
