Primary Project Goal:
Design an 'accessmap lite' inteface that allows users to compute route path with
lowest energy cost, or visualize the terrain attribute of individual street segments.

Project Component Goals:
-attain DEM data for UMN Campus and rectify a street network map to it
-create attribute data for street network that contains slope/length
-create shortest path algorithm with cost as length*slope 
-create web app script/GUI if time


Project Requirements:
-Data integration using python ETL
-Intermediate data analysis techniques
-Connections to background reference
-Extensively documented codebooks
-GitHub Repo with documentation
