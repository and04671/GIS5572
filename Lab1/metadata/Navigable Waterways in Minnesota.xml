During the time period 1990-1995, the BaseMap data layers were digitized from USGS 7.5-minute quadrangles using MicroStation CADD. A total of 1745 quadrangles were digitized. For any given area, MnDOT used the most recent quadrangle available at that time. The digital MicroStation CADD files were converted from State Plane Coordinates to UTM and then converted into ARC/INFO coverages. The ARC/INFO files were merged into statewide, seamless coverages and then attributes were added. The coverage has been updated continuously as information has come in.
